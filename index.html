  <div class="Question"> What is FAFSADITE?</div>
  <div class="Text">We understand that the FAFSA is one of the most confusing components of applying to college. This form can be confusing and assistance can be difficult to find. FAFSADITE (FASFA + Expedite <i>(cool play on words right?</i>) is here to help the college process become less stressful for students and parents. This website is a more relatable, simpler, and helpful source that students can use to figure out if they are eligible for financial help with their education, as well as learning more about the FAFSA. </div>
    <div class="Question">What is the FAFSA?</div>
    <div class="Text">The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is an application that gives applicants free money for tuition from the government. This money is not considered as loans and should be filled out since free money is the best kind of money. n addition to demographic and financial information, applicants can list up to ten schools to receive the results of the application once it is processed. Historically, there was some concern that colleges could deny admission, waitlist applicants, or offer less financial aid as a result of the order in which applicants list schools on the application, or FAFSA position. However, the US Department of Education changed the FAFSA for the 2016-2017 academic year to prevent schools from having access to view other schools that may be listed on the application. After completing the FAFSA, students are presented with a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR provides a student with their potential eligibility for different types of financial aid, their Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and a summary of the data a student provided in the application. Students should carefully review the SAR for errors and make any corrections as necessary. An electronic version of the SAR (called an ISIR) is made available to the colleges/universities the student includes on the FAFSA. The ISIR is also sent to state agencies that award need-based aid.</div><br><br><br>
